# What is a Graph Database?

> "A graph database is a database designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself." - [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/)

A Graph Database uses graphs to store and display relationships between the data. 
There are nodes and arrows: The nodes represent the entity such as a person. They can have any number of properties. 
The arrows represent the relationship between two nodes. They always have a direction, a type, a start node and an end node.
Moreover relationships can have properties, just as nodes. A node can have any number of relationship with another node.

One advantage of a graph database is that its performance stays constant while its data grows unlike the performace of traditional databases.
